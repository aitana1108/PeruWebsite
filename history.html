         <h3>Moche Culture (c. 100 CE – 800 CE)</h3>
         <section class="One">
           <P>The Moche, also known as the Mochica Culture, inhabited a 215-mile stretch of the Peruvian coast from the Lambayeque River to the Nepeña River. Renowned engineers, they built complex canals and irrigation systems to transport water from the Andes to the lowlands, enabling their agricultural society to thrive.
           </P>
           <p> Key Moche sites include the Temple of the Sun (Huacas del Sol) and the Temple of the Moon (Huacas del Luna). Proximity to these sites facilitated regular communal ceremonies and collaboration in producing high-quality pottery and jewelry.</p>
           </section>
           <section >
            <p> The Moche were advanced artisans, using chemical processes to electroplate gold and silver jewelry and creating standardized pottery molds. Their pottery often depicted scenes of warfare and sexual practices, providing insights into their daily life.Although they did not write, the Moche used mnemonic devices like Quipus—strings with knots—to record and remember important numbers and dates.(Think Galapagos, n.d.)</p>

         <h3>Nazca Culture (200 BCE – 600 CE)</h3>
         <section>
            <p>The Nazca Culture thrived in the Ica Valley in southwest Peru's hot, arid desert climate. They are best known for the mysterious Nazca Lines, large geoglyphs best viewed from the sky. These lines, etched into the desert by removing surface rocks to reveal lighter soil underneath, depict animals such as monkeys, spiders, fish, and lizards, as well as human figures and plants. The longest lines measure up to 200 meters.The purpose of the Nazca Lines remains a mystery. Theories include astronomical alignments, religious offerings to gods, and even extraterrestrial landing strips, but none are widely accepted or proven. The enigmatic nature of these geoglyphs adds to their mystical aura, especially considering the Nazca people likely never saw them in their entirety.

         <h3>Chimu Culture (900 CE – 1470 CE)</h3>
         <section class="One">
            <P>
                The Chimu culture flourished in Chimor on Peru's northern coast until their conquest by the Inca rulers Pachacuti Inca Yupanqui and his son Tupa Inca Yupanqui in 1470. Known for their significant contributions to the modernization of ancient Peruvian society, the Chimu had a highly organized agricultural society with communal property and equitable food distribution.
            </P>
            <p>
                The Chimu built Chan Chan, a vast, symmetrical city spanning 20 square kilometers. This ancient city, located near Trujillo, featured elaborate irrigation systems, defensive structures, reservoirs, temples, and pyramids. At its peak, Chan Chan housed up to 100,000 people.

            <h3>The Inca Empire (13th Century – 1572 CE)</h3>
            <section class="Two">
            <p>
                The Inca Empire, the largest in Pre-Columbian America, arose from the highlands of Peru in the 13th century, with Cusco as its capital. Due to Spanish records and extensive archaeological sites, we have a deep understanding of their culture.
                Initially ruling only the Cusco Valley, the Incas expanded rapidly to control territory from Colombia to central Chile. Despite their power, the empire was short-lived, lasting just over 100 years. A civil war between Inca Huáscar and his half-brother Atahualpa in 1525 weakened the empire, facilitating Spanish conquest.The Incas were expert masons, using two styles: Polygonal (large, uneven jigsaw-like stones) and Courses (symmetrical stones). Their structures, including the renowned citadel of Machu Picchu, have withstood the test of time and form the foundation of many modern buildings in Peru.

         <h1>SPANISH CONQUEST  (1532 – 1572)
        </h1>
         <section class="One">
         <p>
            In 1530 Francisco Pizarro landed in the Americas for the second time. Intent on colonising this country rich in natural resources, Pizarro left Ecuador and marched south to Peru, where he founded San Miguel de Piura. This was the first Spanish town in Peru from where the Spanish based themselves and masterminded the colonisation of the country.  
         </p>
         <p>
            However, the Inca Culture had fought hard to create such a vast Empire and they were not going to give up easily. Many a battle took place between the colonisers and the natives, but defeat was inevitable for the Peruvian indigenous who were outdone by the superior military techniques of the Spanish and weakened by the introduction of European diseases such as smallpox. In 1532 the Spaniards captured and assassinated Inca King Atahualpa marking the beginning of the end of the Inca Empire.

            The Spaniards were cunning in manipulating the different allegiances and factions that existed in Peru in order to achieve their immediate and long term goals in the country. Francisco Pizarro first began manipulating the Incas when he lured King Atahualpa into a peaceful meeting where he was captured, locked up and used as a puppet to control the empire until Pizarro eventually had the King killed.

        </h1> 
        <section class="Two">
        <p>
            Colonial Period in Peru
            Founded by Francisco Pizarro in 1535, Lima became the capital of the Vice Royalty of Peru, replacing Cusco after prolonged conflict. Spanish rule led to increased poverty and inequality. In 1780, Túpac Amaru II's rebellion was crushed.
         Christianity's introduction had a lasting impact, with over 80% of Peruvians now Catholic. This influence is evident in the numerous churches and colonial art, such as Marcos Zapata's Last Supper in Cusco's Cathedral, which features a guinea pig, a local delicacy.

            <h1>LIBERATION OF PERU</h1>
        <section class="One">
            <p>
                José de San Martín and Simón Bolívar were key figures in South American independence. San Martín, born in Argentina in 1778, initially served in the Spanish army. In 1811, he moved to Buenos Aires to fight for independence, leading 5,000 men across the Andes to liberate Chile in 1817 and declaring Peru's independence in 1821.
            </p>
            <p>
                Simultaneously, Bolívar was liberating northern regions, including Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador. The two generals met in Guayaquil in 1822. San Martín offered to serve under Bolívar, who declined, prompting San Martín to resign to avoid conflict and ensure unity.

                San Martín spent his final years in Europe, dying in 1850. His remains were returned to Buenos Aires in 1880 and buried in the Metropolitan Cathedral. His sword was later placed in Argentina's Historical Museum. A museum and a monument in Mendoza commemorate his achievements.

                Many practices of the Chimú people, Wari Empire and Inca Empire can still be seen in Peru today. Indigenous Peruvians have been recognised as an ‘Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity,’ for their importance in ‘maintaining cultural diversity in the face of growing globalisation’ by UNESCO. Similarly, the capital of the Chimú Kingdom – Chan Chan – is today a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which has been recognised for its ‘Outstanding Universal Value.’

                Smaller cultural traditions have also stood the test of time, such as using llamas and alpacas for transport, using their dung for fertiliser, and their wool for textiles. The ancient language of Quechua is still widely spoken, and Inca ceremonies celebrating the Sun God Inti and Pachamama (the worship of the earth) happen annually.There are three official languages in Peru; over 80% speak Spanish, however many speak the native languages of Quechua and Aymara.(Anon, 2021)
