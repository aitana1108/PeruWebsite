            <section id="discover-wonders">
                <h2>Discover the Wonders of Peru</h2>
                <p>Lima, the sprawling capital of Peru, is not only the gateway to Peruvian adventures but also a treasure trove of history itself. The city's architecture paints a picture of its colonial past under Spanish rule with preserved cathedrals and palaces such as the Basilica and Convent of San Francisco, famous for its catacombs containing the bones of about 25,000 bodies. The city is a cultural hub with numerous museums like the Museo Larco, which hosts a collection of over 45,000 pieces of pre-Columbian art. The museum is housed in an 18th-century vice-royal building built over a 7th-century pre-Columbian pyramid.</p>
                <p>Lima's modernity is showcased in its vibrant gastronomy scene that is recognized worldwide, offering an eclectic mix of flavors that incorporate traditional indigenous ingredients with international culinary techniques. Lima is often dubbed the 'Gastronomy Capital of Latin America', owing to its variety of seafood dishes such as ceviche, made from fresh raw fish marinated in freshly squeezed key lime or bitter orange juice, spiced with ají chili peppers and seasoned with chopped onions, salt, and cilantro. Not only a feast for the taste buds, but Lima also hosts Mistura, one of the largest food festivals in Latin America, attracting food lovers from around the world.</p>
                <p>The Barranco district is Lima's artistic heart, known for its bohemian lifestyle and being the cradle of many of Peru's leading musicians, writers, and artists. During the day, the area is a picturesque scene of colorful colonial mansions, boutiques and coffee shops, while at night it transforms into one of Lima's most vibrant nightlife scenes with bars, clubs, and discos offering live music ranging from traditional Peruvian folk to modern pop and rock.</p>

            <!-- What to See -->
            <section id="what-to-see">
                <h2>What to See</h2>
                <p>The Sacred Valley, just north of Cusco and stretching towards Machu Picchu, is an essential part of any visit to Peru. This region was the heart of the Inca Empire, which left behind a landscape scattered with relics, ruins and ancient towns. The valley is not only rich in archaeology but also in agriculture, maintaining ancient practices on terraces that climb up the steep valley sides. Visitors can explore the market at Pisac, a colorful melting pot of local culture, offering handicrafts, garments, and jewelry made from local materials and traditional methods.</p>
                <p>Machu Picchu, the mystical city in the clouds, was rediscovered in 1911 by Hiram Bingham and is believed to have been a royal estate or sacred religious site for Inca leaders. Its architectural precision coupled with its dramatic location are virtually unmatched. It is the most familiar icon of the Incan World. The journey to Machu Picchu itself is a spectacular adventure, whether approached by a scenic train ride along the river or by trekking the challenging Inca Trail, offering breathtaking views and passing through diverse ecosystems.</p>
                <p>Lake Titicaca on the border of Peru and Bolivia is famed not only for its spectacular blue waters but for its floating islands of Uros, which are made entirely of reeds harvested from the lake. The Uros people, who live on these forty-two self-fashioned floating islands, continue to maintain their ancient way of life, fishing, weaving, and trading in totora reeds. The islands are a testament to human ingenuity, and their construction is constantly maintained, with new reeds added to the top as they rot from the bottom, so the ground is always soft and springy.</p>

            <!-- What to Do -->
            <section id="what-to-do">
                <h2>What to Do</h2>
                <p>Peru offers a rich tapestry of tangible adventures. Trekking the Inca Trail provides not only a strenuous challenge but also a rewarding journey through breathtaking landscapes, culminating in the arrival at Machu Picchu. The trail takes hikers over high passes, past ancient Incan ruins, and through diverse environments including cloud forests and alpine tundra, requiring several days to complete with nights spent camping under the stars.</p>
                <p>The Amazon Rainforest covers approximately 60% of the country and offers a vastly different experience from the Andean highlands. Visitors can embark on guided tours in boats to explore the dense jungle, visit native communities, and observe wildlife from caimans to jaguars. The city of Iquitos offers a gateway to the northern Amazon, providing an urban contrast to the surrounding wilderness with its vibrant market and floating shantytowns.</p>
                <p>The city of Cusco, once the capital of the Incan Empire, today is the hub for visitors heading to Machu Picchu. However, it's also known for its archaeological sites like Sacsayhuamán, an immense walled complex constructed of large polished stone walls, each boulder carefully cut to fit together tightly without mortar. Cusco is further enriched during the celebrations of Inti Raymi, the Festival of the Sun, which takes place every year on June 24th. This festival sees the city explode with color, music, and dancing in a tradition that dates back to the Inca times.</p>

    <!-- Plan Your Trip -->
    <section id="plan-your-trip">
        <h2>Plan Your Trip</h2>
        <p>Visiting Peru demands consideration of its varied climates, which vary dramatically between its coastal regions, mountainous areas, and the Amazon rainforest. The coastal strip features a desert climate with Lima experiencing mild temperatures year-round and the northern beaches enjoying warm sunny weather, perfect for enjoying the surf and sand. In contrast, the Andean region, including Cusco and the Sacred Valley, has two distinct seasons: a dry season from May through October, ideal for hiking and outdoor activities, and a wet season from November through April, which can see significant rainfall but also vibrant landscapes and fewer tourists.</p>
        <p>The best time to visit the Amazon Rainforest is during the dry season, from May to October, when fewer rains make for less flooding of the riverways, providing easier access and better wildlife viewing opportunities. However, the wet season brings its own unique beauty, filling the waterways and bringing the jungle to lush, vibrant life. Regardless of when you plan your trip, Peru offers distinct experiences that can be tailored to your interests, from bird watching and hiking to photography and culinary tours.</p>
        <p>For those planning to explore Machu Picchu, it's important to book your tickets and tours well in advance as visitor numbers are capped to protect the site. Similarly, if you're hiking the Inca Trail, permits are required and are limited to help preserve the trail. Early planning can ensure you secure your spot on one of the world's most famous hikes.</p>

    <!-- Travel Essentials -->
    <section id="travel-essentials">
        <h2>Travel Essentials</h2>
        <p>Before embarking on your journey to Peru, ensure all travel documentation is in order, including passports and, if necessary, visas. Citizens from most American and European countries do not require a visa for stays of up to 183 days. It's crucial to check the most current visa requirements from the Peruvian embassy or consulate in your country, as regulations can change.</p>
        <p>Health and safety are paramount when traveling in Peru. Vaccinations for hepatitis A, typhoid, and yellow fever are recommended, especially if visiting the Amazon region. Consideration for altitude sickness should also be made when visiting high-altitude areas such as Cusco or Lake Titicaca; medications like Acetazolamide can be prescribed to help mitigate symptoms. Always have travel insurance that covers medical emergencies and unexpected trip cancellations or delays.</p>
        <p>Packing for Peru should be versatile to accommodate its varied climates. Essentials include high SPF sunscreen, hats for sun protection, sturdy walking shoes, and layers that can be added or removed as temperatures change. Waterproof gear is also recommended, particularly if visiting during the rainy season or planning to venture into the Amazon.</p>

        <p>For those who enjoy road trips, Peru's extensive network of buses connects virtually all cities and towns, offering varying levels of service from basic to luxurious. The bus journey can provide a scenic view of the Peruvian landscape, from coastal plains to mountain passes, and is a cost-effective way to travel.</p>
        <p>Rail travel offers a uniquely scenic and relaxed way to explore Peru. The train from Cusco to Machu Picchu is one of the most famous rail journeys globally, providing stunning views of the Andes. Other notable rail trips include the route from Cusco to Puno, which runs along the spectacular Andean plains.</p>
